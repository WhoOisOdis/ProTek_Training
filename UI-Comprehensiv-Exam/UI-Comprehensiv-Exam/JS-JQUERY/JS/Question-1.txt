You have 40 mins to code this.

Create a simple form and write JS code to validate the form. No need to style the form. A plain form should be OK. Spend more time on JS.

You should be using Object Oreinted programming concepts in order to validate the form.[This is Mandatory]

The form should contain the following fields:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Username
- State Dropdown (5 US states should be good)
- Gender [radio buttons]
- I agree to terms and conditions
- SUBMIT Button [should be disabled by default].

The field should be validated as soon as the user focuses out of the field (hint: on blur). If the field is empty then add red border to that field. No need to check for patterns (regular expressions not needed).

Once all the fields are validated, the submit button should be enabled.
