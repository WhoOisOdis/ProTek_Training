By default, only the "Show Items in Cart" button should be visible on the page. No table should be shown.

You are given a data.json file with 20 records.

When the user clicks on the "Show Items in Cart" button, he/she should see the first 8 items in the cart in a tabular view.

The data should be pulled from json file. The data contains the information about order and wishlist. Users should only see the transactions from wishlist.

The user should be able to delete each item from the tabular view.

Use Twitter Bootstrap to make the table and buttons looks elegant.

When the user clicks on DELETE button, the whole record (tr) should be deleted from the UI.
[When the page is refresh and clicked again on the SHow items button, the deleted row will appear again - this is OK].
