This task should be completed in 15mins.

By default all the "formbox" containers should be hidden. Only the radio button and the text beside the radio buttons should be visible.

When the user clicks on any of the radio button/label text, the corresponding form container should slide down.

When the user clicks on other radio button/label text, 
	-any previously open form containers should slide up and
	-the corresponding form container should slide down. 

So at any given point of time, only one form should be shown on the screen.

Example: When the user clicks on "Billing", the radio button should be selected and the form related to Billing should slide down. 
Now, when the user clicks on "Shipping Details", 
	-then the "Billing" form div should slide up and
 	- "Shipping Details" form div should slide down.
